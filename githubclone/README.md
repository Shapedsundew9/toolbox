# GitHub Repository Cloner

This Python script clones all public repositories of a specified GitHub user.

## How it works

1. The script first fetches a list of all public repositories for the given GitHub username using the GitHub API.
2. It then iterates over each repository and clones it into a specified destination folder.

## Usage

The script is used as follows:

```python
python script_name.py
```
